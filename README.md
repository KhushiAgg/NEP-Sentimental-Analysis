# NEP-Sentimental-Analysis

This colaboratory notebook is about doing performance analysis of various machine learning classification models using twitter data on NEP (NATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY)

The data was obtained in real time from twitter using twitter api and the models were trained using the real time data.

The different algorithms used were:
* Random Forest 
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machine
* XGBoost
* Naive Bayes

## Results

The best performing algorithm was Decision Tree whereas the worst performing one was Naive Bayes. 

## Future Work

I should work on obtaining more data and train models on more data so that the training data is not biased to one kind of sentiment (i.e. Positive in our case). And also I should try experimenting with the different parameters of the Machine Learning models to achieve greater accuracy.
